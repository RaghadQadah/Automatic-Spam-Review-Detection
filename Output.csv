---2eJpQ2HAnRQRp2v7XLA,#NAME?,I came to Chicago on business and was initially supposed to stay downtown; however a colleague recommended this hotel--and I am so glad that they did! The attention to detail and finishing touches in my room are what made this hotel feel like home. Staying in a smaller hotel allowed me to connect with the local Chicago vibe while simultaneously enjoying exquisite service from the staff at a fraction of what it might cost to stay in a Magnificent Mile high-rise. Considering the quality ambiance and charm of this hidden Chicago treasure it made my trip a memorable experience. Not only was I able to secure a bike rental to avoid the high cost of renting a car but I also was directed to some of the local galleries in the West Loop by the friendly staff members.,5,5,9/28/2011,#NAME?,0,2,0

--87QVdPvgbDK3GeVxFRzg,92rtlWxS2aOngzkKhi-OxQ,My family has been using Korean Air for many many years now. Going to Asia Korean Air is one of the lowest priced airlines and yet their service is not compromised. The flight attendants are lovely professional and polite. Check in is good and the meals served are also good. The only thing is that if you have to speak with their customer service line it's quite hard to communicate with their staff. Luckily I have some Korean friends and they have done the talking for us otherwise it couldve been worse. All their baggage policies are the standard international size and weight limitations. I suggest not only with this airline but with all airlines to familiarize yourself with their change cancellation and baggage policies before you commit. Airlines will serve the food their country,4,0,7/28/2012,92rtlWxS2aOngzkKhi-OxQ,43,158,0
--99ZJoVHP32iSd4i4nlZw,Egu4qSFR56EhGuTHZTaVjA,I hadn't been to Grisanti's since a pre-homecoming dinner in high school so I had no idea what to expect.  But since I had watched a cooking show that involved homemade ravioli last night that's what I had my heart set on when we arrived.  I figured... Italian Restaurant has to have ravioli right? Well long story short they didn't (except for the fried appetizer kind) and I settled for spinach and chicken manicotti.  But before I got to that I indulged in copious amounts of the complementary never-ending butter-injected bread with marinara sauce.  Then I opted for a cup of 'roasted onion soup' in lieu of salad (but had salad also since everyone else at the table ordered it and it was served family style).   The soup (which I guess they don't want to call 'French Onion' since that woul,3,0,1/28/2010,Egu4qSFR56EhGuTHZTaVjA,133,725,0
#NAME?,6PEIKIibsT3NkG1THRfJPg,I have eyed this shop at the Old orchard location and was thrilled to have time to wander into the Evanston shop. First off- let me say the the you girl who was working (short reddish hair glasses and piercings) was incredibly friendly and helpful.  My mother and I were in the shop close to closing time but that did not deter her from grabbing other merchandise to show us and really helping us!  She was ab Fab. The pricing is incredibly cheap.  I picked up a cape/sweater thing for the office for 38$.  My mother picked up a great sweater to throw on to go shopping etc for the same price. I mean really.  38$?   The selection of gifts and cards is really cute.  I am a fan of this place!,4,1,11/20/2011,6PEIKIibsT3NkG1THRfJPg,86,478,0

--C-lbQ1ewqAO2UGhk0Xlw,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,So this was my first Yelp outing... I arrived right around 7:30 pm - a few others were there before me - we had to stand outside for a few minutes - which did not bother me. We had a little room in the back to ourselves. Before ordering we had to negotiate with our server about the fact that several of us needed to have separate checks as we were paying with credit cards - our server tried to make this into a difficult task - but in the end we got what we wanted. I eagerly looked over the menu since I had heard good things about this place. I was disappointed to see that there was no Poki offering on the menu. So I asked anyway - no no Poki. So then I ordered Miso soup Edamame and a variety of rolls and Nigiri sashimi. First I was informed that they were out of Edamame then out of sc,3,4,11/18/2007,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,1388,2530,0
#NAME?,OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA,Not having a sweet tooth not being a non-cupcake aficionado I love Yelp for pointing out little gems like the Hummingbird Bakery. Am I right in saying that cupcakes are an American obsession which is slowly translating itself across the Atlantic and in years to come just like the indigenous red squirrels of today we'll be creating special protected areas to try to stop the humble English custard tart from being wiped out by its more aggressive American cake cousin? From the outside the cute arrangement of the different coloured tarts in the window display made me think it was an art gallery until the words Hummingbird Bakery over the shop triggered the latent Yelp memories. So I told my friend confidently that this was the best cupcake in town according to my knowledgeable Yelp friends,4,2,5/31/2009,OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA,754,1693,0
#NAME?,jO44Apni7iJZVVK4HQ60tA,Ok the wait this time was decent despite a packed house.  I went at 12:45 so perhaps that made the difference.  Back to 3 stars. We split a dragon roll  a spicy salmon roll and a crab salad roll.  So sue us we were hungry.   The eel on the dragon roll was really good this time-- fresh and moist.  The salmon was fantastic-- really fresh high quality vibrant and buttery.  Points for drsssing the salmon so it lacked any of those tough stringy things.  You know what I'm talking about.  Those things completely ruin a bite of sushi for me.  The edamame were slightly overcooked.  Like I said we were hungry.   If the quality remains this high consistently they will remain in my good graces.  And isn't that what everyone wants?,3,0,Update - 12/11/2008,jO44Apni7iJZVVK4HQ60tA,34,166,0

#NAME?,3zxy3LVBV3ttxoYbY4rQ8A,If you think being past out in the backseat of a cab is proof of a kick-ass night well you're wrong. To end the night with a bang you MUST go to Mai's Restaurant for a late night snack (read: feast). It's also a good choice for lunch/casual dinner. Entrees are served family-style (big plates serving spoon) so sharing is encouraged. Top picks: Start off with spring rolls served with mounds of fresh greens (you'll need that extra hydration boozehounds); Vietnamese egg rolls steaming hot crispy goodness with a side of jalepeno-adorned fish sauce; garlic beef (or chicken) infused with soppy sauce veggies and piles of fully-cooked and soft garlic cloves--almost as savory as the meat--and of course fried rice.

#NAME?,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,BJ's recently opened a location over in Virginia Gateway in Gainesville VA. I received an invitation in the mail for a two month trial membership - so I went in to check it out. I had the option of signing up for a year beyond the 2 month trial membership for $40.00. If I waited for the 2 month trial membership to expire and then make a decision on membership - at that point the price would be $50.00 for a year. So I went ahead and signed up for the year - which means I have 14 months for $40.00. Because the place is so new the place looks nice and clean. I went and stocked up on things like bottled water dishwasher detergent and dishwasher drying agent. The one thing I will ding them on is their Membership Services area seemed a little disorganized.

#NAME?,A3Rahgq3ufx81IjbEfAbGg,I wish I could give another star but was disappointed in the service. The staff is great and friendly we were just there for about 2 hours just to eat breakfast. Thank goodness they served us a mini-muffin prior to our order coming out I was hungry! My friend and I went in and let them know we were going to sit outside. They noted they would be right out to service. We waited about 15 minutes. Once we placed our order we had another friend join us about 30 min later and place an order. Our third friend got his breakfast in a matter of 10 minutes. It was over an hour later when they noted they messed up our order (cook staff was looking at tables 1 & 2 vs. our table #12) ....something to that effect.

#NAME?,bTlonpHjT0p7gF8Ex9XlVw,I always get great haircuts here and I have difficult hair.  The shop is unpretentious and there was no waiting.  Natilee takes the time necessary to do it right. The only thing that would make Natilee's better for me is if her shop was closer to my office.  Still the drive is worthwhile. Call to make an appointment and don't be late.  Natilee runs on-time and works fast. Final thoughts:  If you don't already know who Steve McQueen was and what he's famous for you might want to brush up on that before you go.  You'll still get a killer haircut but the conversation will be more interesting if you're conversant about Steve. P.S.  Natilee does great work at a very reasonable price so tip well.,5,1,8/05/2011,bTlonpHjT0p7gF8Ex9XlVw,7,71,0
#NAME?,mffer6ORgLqxB8ZeemxmHQ,I attended a funeral reception here recently and it was exactly what you would expect and nothing more.  In writing this review I realized that places like this exist for funerals.  It was interesting that the place had 2 funeral parties going on at once.  It doesn't matter how good the food and the atmosphere are when you are gathering people for a quick funeral meal.  For that I retract a few of the previous comments.  The meal was average but it was served by people who really seemed to care that we were happy and enjoying ourselves.  The the bartenders and waitstaff were incredibly nice.  The gentlemen at the stale cigarette-smelling bar kept us all happy. The appetizers were deviled eggs and sausage in a brown gravy.    The meal was a variety of sides beef and gravy and roaste,2,1,8/20/2012,mffer6ORgLqxB8ZeemxmHQ,23,184,0

Now after 18 years I still go back every now and then for their gyros and their cheese fries.  The gyros are carved off the spit as soon as you order it and then put on the grill for a couple of minutes or so giving the pieces a nice crisp edge.  With their tzatziki sauce tomatoes and wrapped in a warm pita it is the perfect lunch or dinner.  Their cheese fries taste the way I always r,4,2,7/10/2011,_crXbz-jmEjkyyT95SAwug,4,61,0
#NAME?,NZba-Q-Fp10iF77CTQt24Q,QuikTrip is great for sooo many reasons. * All of their stores are always clean and well lit. * You get greeted when you walk inside. * They take checks (seriously this comes in handy every once-in-a-while). * Gas prices are usually the lowest in town. * All of their fuel products are guaranteed although I'm not really sure what that means. This location is just over the train tracks in Vinings about a mile from I-285. It's usually really busy but you can get in and out easily.

#NAME?,bYENop4BuQepBjM1-BI3fA,The IHOP in my neighborhood closed after 50 years and we kind of miss them for a cheap breakfast. I wish they'd tear down the old building and build us a new one like this location. The inside is more modern but still very compact and tight. They make use of every inch but doing so puts the tables close together. It also makes the table tops small and crowded once your food arrives. However IHOP serves up a good cheap breakfast. Their Breakfast Sampler gives you everything you'd want for your morning meal. You'll enjoy two of everything; eggs your way bacon sausage ham pancakes and a hearty side of hash browns.  It's almost too much food I always bring some bacon and sausage home for the dogs.

My mom knows good Mexican and she brought me here. I must say I chose simple tacos al carbon (al pastor - with onions and cilantro) and they were quite delicious. Of course I had to stab my fork into every ones plates to taste what they were having (fajitas tamales etc) and the guac was fan-flippin'- tastic.

One of the highlights was the three Shiner beers on tap: Bock 102 and the Ruby Red.  All fresh and cold and only $5 for 20 oz. We had two entrees: the barbacoa special and the enchiladas.  I've never had better.  Usually enchiladas are just a mess of cheese and a sauce.  These were flavorful and bite after bite you could taste the distinctive flavors.,5,0,7/30/2011,WKpzoB_oom4OSEe703-uxw,29,142,0

Duckpin bowling is apparently a dying sport... unlike regular bowling duckpin has more pins and smaller balls. Oh also you get three balls for each turn.  You need all three though- those pins are small and hard to hit!  There are only a few alleys left in the United States that have duckpin bowling and apparently Plaza Bowl was about to close when a heroic local citizen stepped in and saved it.  He is now trying to renovate it little by little so he asks that you do your part by not trashing the bathroom and paying a cover charge to get in,4,4,5/25/2010,I7YQFiIsO82eliq8nqsLfA,192,523,0

I love it that it's such a nice simple spot and has a lot of outdoor seating.  If I'm not careful I can really splurge in the place so I try to keep it to flights so I can at least have some variety in my vino drinking.

Basically I've had it with this place.  The food isn't that great their nutritional info can only be ascertained via the brochure (and isn't all that appealing for what seems to be a healthy living place) and there's a GNC-like place in it which I find disconcerting.  Blech.   The service isn't too bad which may be the only redeeming factor but there are much better places for food,1,1,Update - 7/26/2008,HUmClClluKP5Ur6X7e306Q,128,900,0

We didn't have a view but didn't really need one given the short amount of time we were there. Location is good with a handful of restaurants within walking distance as well as a post office and Walgreens which is always helpful! The lobby is lovely with a fireplace flat screen TV and wine tastings. We missed the tasting so upon check-in the receptionist sent up some glasses to make up for it which was a nice gesture. Even nicer they brought up two full bottles by mistake which we made sure to enjoy by the fire.

I am not bothered by the behemoth Target I'm not bothered by the corporate employees I'm not bothered by the creepy people.

The food was simply done right. Aside from the half-hour wait the rest of the experience was phenomenal. The waiter was candid which is great at breaking up the monotony of your typical mundane server. We started with the steak fries and  Irish curry sauce which was exceptional considering I'm not much of a fan of either. The fries were fresh and the Irish curry sauce embodied everything you love about curry but with a little hint of sweetness to it. I had the fish and chips for my main course. Growing up in Wisconsin you eat a lot of fish fries in your day but this one stands out because the fish is ridiculously fresh and moist.

However since then they have diluted the brand cheapened the experience and skimped on service so I docked them a star for that. I've always enjoyed going to Fishbone's however bring your Diamond card because they are expensive.  Granted they are not as expensive as they used to be ($100/plate not even ten years ago) but they are still in the neighborhood of $30+/person). They usually have a live band of a decent caliber performing most evenings. The food is generally acceptable and the service is mediocre now. They do not take reservations though and if you step out of line to go to the bathroom or to get a drink from the bar you lose your place.

I will admit the service started out slow the waiter would take half of our drink order and disappear. Then reappear with the first round and finish taking the rest of the orders.  Perhaps a dozen Yelpers could be intimidating. Once he started to take the food orders a spark appeared in his personality. He truly seemed to enjoy talking about the entrees and the spice levels of each dish.

However the quality and portions are pretty good (again like Gloucester) and I've yet to be disappointed. On my last visit I finally sampled their 'house special' baked pork chop on rice - my standard HK cafe dish and my litmus test for HK cafes.  It was about $8 late-night and it's $0.50 extra for a cold drink and $1 more if you want the extra-large drink (which is only slightly bigger than the standard glass).  Yup - again even the annoying drink pricing is exactly like Gloucester.

Reif has a very cute wine tasting standing room with a bar area for the educator to stand behind and pour the samplings. I tried a white red and ice wine at Reif and loved them all. Reif Estates was actually my favorite winery on the tour because of their delicious wines. Those I tried I found to be the most sweet and smooth of anywhere which I really liked. I tried their amazing Vidal Icewine and was given a special recipe card for a duck confit,5,1,9/03/2012,QnIrewrXxFnssw_gG1gF-Q,76,738,0

He must have asked 5 times to order a side of potatoes but no one wanted potatoes. I could tell you about the food we ordered which was good but the service was too much and too pushy. I am from Los Angeles and love The Grill in the Alley in Beverly Hills but they are not aggressive and inconsiderate. I didn't like it at all and it ruined my dining experience.  As it is with bottles of wine appetizers and steaks the bill is going to be hefty so I don't understand why the waiter wouldn't back off.

My favorite menu items are the fish tacos and the hamburgers.  The fish tacos are delicious I have ordered them on my last two visits. My wife ordered a burger with the usual toppings but she could only eat half of it.  Now you know I'm not going to let the other half go to waste.  Surprisingly this is one of the best burgers I've had - ever!  This burger beat Swenson's 1/2 pounder in my opinion taking the number one spot for BEST BURGER IN CLEVELAND.   I've only tried it once however so I'll need to go back again and eat another one just to be sure.  Previously Swenson's h,4,3,5/09/2010,nOr3_aq60yivqgcso_iDMw,76,232,0

This Chili's location is close to the three hospitals and Vanderbilt University.  In fact 10 to 12 years ago when I attended Vanderbilt this place was always hopping with students on a Friday or Saturday night because it was cheap and convenient. (Yes snarky people even Vanderbilt students like to eat cheap-ish food.  We're students too.)  The location is like any other location of Chili's (hence it is a chain restaurant).  The food is mediocre to less-than-mediocre the service is moderately slow to darned slow,2,2,2/11/2012,T9AtZPYC4W81rylyvOOmQQ,23,240,0

(It also makes me really happy when I can order churros) All of the staff is well-dressed and polite. They are hardworking and you can see it in the service and taste it in the food. The secret to this place is to order chicken or steak. They have the best marinated meats ever. I think their chicken is marinated in a beer and lime marinade. It is so yummy. I also recommend their margaritas. You can taste the love. And they have lots of it!

We came again a few days ago during the week days - parking lots empty stores deserted and no lineups for the washrooms! It actually felt weird odd walking around i think we were done the entire outlet in less than 2 hours. Anyways I went into coach and they had 50% off everything!! Honestly what more could you ask for?! Yet there has been times where I walked in and they had 50% off + additional 30% off.... but still just as good.

I had been meaning to check out Happy Elephant anyways and they are so close that I really didn't have an excuse not to try them. They have a great menu with a variety of foods. I ended up getting the eggs rolls crab rangoons and the Peanut Chicken Rama. It was delivered quickly was still hot and fresh and tasted wonderful!

As I approached the Future of Flight building I was getting excited as I saw rows of new aircraft parked up and the enormous Boeing assembly building. The experience consists of a 40 minute tour of the assembly plant and a walk round the museum. The tour started with multiple warnings (to be often repeated) about no electronic equipment. At least there were cheap lockers for rental to leave your stuff in the main building. There were 2 short films in the museum building but these were disappointing. No voiceover no explanantions very crackly film like they had been shown too many times.

Yes it's a foot long but there's only a couple of slices of meat and they rely heavily on condiments for flavor. With that said I had an amazing experience here. Apparently my grandmother is a big fan and we stopped here on our way back from running errands in Austell. The subs are mediocre. The employees are awesome. My grandmother is a very young 84. She likes to ask a lot of questions and probably repeats herself sometimes. It doesn't bother me because I love her (and she acts 15 years younger).

Maybe I just make really good sangria but me or my boyfriend were not very impressed. My sources say that the sangria is just a mix of their leftover wines with fruit added in. We each ordered our three dishes the only one we both ordered was the lomo de cerdo which was amazing and everyone should order. We also had the seafood and noodle dish which wasn't bad but was VERY seafoody but rather filling for a small dish. The crab cake balls were excellent and so was the pork ravioli.

Youngish guys looking their best to impress young ladies.  If the boys have no chance they get too drunk and burden their friends and sometimes those around them.  As for the ladies they too are on the prowl or hanging a little less drunk then their male counterparts. Overall it was an OK experience but seems a little too stereotypical for a UES Saturday night. I certainly don't think Sherlock Holmes would frequent this establishment.

To make a long story short it is good to see that Morton took the review seriously and wanted to apologize about the service that I had received. Thanks to yelp and thanks to Morton's for making extra effort to provide better service for its guests. For a first class joint with fantastic steak it is both service and food that compliments each other. Morton's went a step ahead to make it perfect. I am leaving the original review as is so go with an open mind and hopefully you will have a great time - enjoy the steak regardless:) Original Review: Steak was good. The rest was terrible.

It was loud there were a lot of drunk people running around and it looked COMPLETELY different from what I remember. I heard a rumor that they fired all of their old staff to make room for a new hip staff. As much as I don't want to believe it based on our experience last weekend it can only be true. Service was slow and indifferent even outright rude at times. Our food took for.ev.er. to reach us and our waiter was nowhere to be found most of the time especially when he knew we had flagged down someone else looking for my cup of soup they forgot or my mom's side salad that they also forgot.

-79dK1n7tbkZ-lpSVoLz9Q,#NAME?,We started off with the empanadas and pupusas not something I would expect to see on a Mexican menu. The empanadas had softer dough shell (not flaky) that was stuffed with either pork chicken and cheese. The pupusas were round pancake like corn disks filled with either pork or cheese. The pork had the best flavor and the texture was a cross of a pancake and corn bread. The server was really nice and brought me a  small tasting of the creamy butternut squash soup which had lovely hints of spice. I couldn't decide between empanadas or soup so I tried both! They serve large portions here but we continued to stuff ourselves with the entrees. We ordered the Carnitas Uruapan Chicken Mole Carne Asada and a daily special of ribs.

I'm probably not the first to say this but the rooms are a bit stodgy.  They could use new carpet and the TV's look between 15-20 years old.  Big plusses with this hotel - Burger Bueno and In-N-Out burger are located just across the hotel parking lot.  So is Walgreen's for the added convenience factor.,3,1,4/16/2012,k3ICHfTb433rFxAO3BsqEg,8,142,0

She has done many more on me since my first visit and I am planning on going back to her soon. She knows what she's doing and has been doing it for many many years so experience is on her side.

Prices are still higher and expiration dates still sooner than the same items stocked at Jewel or Dominick's but perhaps my previous assessment of two stars was unfair. Three's more like it. That said I would never shop here on a regular basis. Peapod even after its delivery fee is a cheaper option.

-8Fra8DT6-AMQGv1ib_RbA,AcGBRI0xZCuQ1Z85zFVLWw,Stopped here looking for an iron gate to go outside the home we're restoring. Found a perfect one propped up against the building outside except for two glaringly large problems: (1) It had a price tag of $2600. TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS. For a small rusty iron gate. This just doesn't seem right to me especially considering that an Internet search indicated that similarly-sized ones seem to be going from other salvage places for a third of that price. (2) There was a sign on the door saying that they were closed and wouldn't be reopening until May 14th. I'm no financial guru or anything but I think slashing their prices and opening their doors could do wonders for this place.,1,0,4/25/2011,AcGBRI0xZCuQ1Z85zFVLWw,76,213,0

-8hLefFwjxKLDMM_PSMPYg,#NAME?,It comes down to this: there are other places that do Chicago food way better. Most of these reviewers have already pegged it. I like to go a couple times to a place before I review it just to be fair. Sure Maxwell's is a rip-off of other restaurants (they have a chocolate cake there that looks as if it's a lesser quality Portillo's clone; I did not order it). But before there was Portillo's there was the the beloved Maxwell Street in Chicago that gave way to University Village and The University of Chicago. They ripped them off first -- but themed restaurants aren't anything new and I wouldn't fault them on that alone. If that were it. The first thing you notice is the sloppy tile edging work in the turnabout. That shouldn't annoy me as much as it does -- and it probably wouldn't annoy m,2,5,6/11/2009,#NAME?,34,199,0

We went early on a Saturday as we have a 2 year old and it seems that there were plenty others there who had the same idea.  This isn't really the most kid-friendly place to bring a child but what I loved was that we weren't charged for our little guy.  I'm not sure if that's the norm or at what age that kicks in but since he had some of the salad bar items and only a little bit of the bacon-wrapped chicken he was still satisfied and full and we didn't have to g,4,1,4/20/2010,WZq0FC-0HS6_R4pKUy_3Ig,58,225,1

Discount Tire will price match on their tires which is awesome. They were selling s.drive tires for $91 and Tire Rack was $71. I filled out a little form online Sunday night and the next morning someone from this store called me to offer me $81 per tire essentially the Tire Rack price plus shipping. I ended up getting too involved in other stuff and called over Wednesday to set up everything. I didn't realize I was going to have to put down $200 for them to order the tires and was unprepared all day without the right credit card.

If I ever go back I'll get that and salad. The salads did look good. Usually in a large group they will add the tip. They didn't here.

This was one of the best decisions I've made this holiday season! The first part that caught my eye was the $10-per-person price tag and the second part was the menu itself: BOTH turkey breast and ham stuffing rolls cranberry relish AND my choice of 3 sides. I chose garlic mashed (completely delicious) corn and cheddar casserole (yummo) and green beans with bacon & onions (very good). Oh and there was TONS of each item.

We had Spicy Calamari and Tuna Ceviche for appetizers and both had Pasta Bolognese for our main course.  The Calamari was good unfortunately not spicy though.  The tuna was very good especially if you poured the soy sauce they served with it all over.  I was a bit confused though as they served soy sauce and guacamole on the side of the service.  So is it Mexican or Asian service?

It reminds me a lot of Panda Garden in Lawrence a favorite of both mine and the K. The proprietress of this establishment adds a whole other dimension of awesome to Fan's. She's really welcoming and accommodating. For our group she offered a vegetarian dumpling option which is not something that is usually on the menu.

Parking in the garage was $20 (which I think is ok for a venue like this) but there was parking across the street for $10 and $5 a tad farther away. Pro to being in the garage is being close to the arena...and if it;s raining there is a bridge connecting the two. Prices were higher than outside venues ($5+ for sodas $8+ for beers $6+ for food) but you shoul expect that when going to a professional arena. Restrooms were clean and there were plenty of them.

Once I realized they served Stumptown coffee (my favourite) - I decided to grab some dessert before I headed to the park. So after waiting in a short line and seeing people order dozens of compost cookies and crack pies -- I was intrigued to say the least.  So I ordered my coffee and a compost cookie... which has (deep inhale)... pretzels potato chips coffee oats butterscotch & chocolate chips... it's like a McGangBang... but in a cookie. I jaunt down to Union Square with my cookie and piping hot coffee and grab a bench.  Settling in on a nice autumn afternoon - I figure life is damned good.

This restaurant is consistently delicious and delivers its amazing fare with classy friendly and professional service. It is a gem in downtown dining! The first year we came here we dined here the evening after I had run the half-marathon in the morning. I don't remember a great deal about it aside from not feeling too good after running my heart out but I do remember how friendly the host was and how amazingly good the bread pudding was! I can still taste it! Every year since then we've made reservations for the night before the race for ourselves and friends who are also running and we have never been disappointed.

#NAME?,f1MFQxTZAWJnRQdrouLg_A,Well...the pizza is good and they have an above average beer list. That's gotta count for something right? I've had this place on my radar for a while simply because I had been told by people in the craft beer circles that this Northland restaurant and bar was aggressively trying to make a name for itself. This always struck me as odd as the name sounds more akin to Showbiz Pizza or Chuck E Cheese than to a beer bar or any place for people over 9. But not wanting to judge a book by it's cover I went along with some friends. I was closer to being correct than I had ever seriously imagined. Walking in the front door the space is divided into what seems to be a main bar and a dining room. Our party was too large to fit into the bar so we were in the dining area.

It's a nice hotel don't get me wrong it's kind of not my style if I wanted to stay there I've stayed in better hotels than this one. It looks too boughie for me and it seems like it has nothing on hotels like the Four Seasons and the Ritz Carlton where world class service is part of the hotel's mantra. This place just looked like you come in for an after work drink and then go home. I left out of the show I was at because it wasnt worth the $40 wasted on craptastic appetizers and watered down drinks since the people there were getting loaded on Pearinis (pear martinis) mixed with Grey Goose vodka and acting foolish.

#NAME?,6PEIKIibsT3NkG1THRfJPg,What a name for a eatery! Seriously! This mild mannered place looks like it was established sometime in the early 70's. The faux rock exterior and sign proclaiming cocktails may set you into the wrong mind set. Alas... there are no male strippers. BUT What a fantastic name for a male strip club! CAN you imagine?? You could have an entire theme going. In fact- the clientele was elderly men chowing down... one was even having a hot toddy at 11:30 on a Tuesday. They brought it immediately when he sat down- his regular order! In fact- a work colleague and I headed in here after a meeting for lunch- kind of hoping that is what we would find... instead we ended up having a late breakfast. The decor takes you back a good 20 years or so. Service is fast the gypsy skillet was devoured by both of ,3,1,8/15/2009,6PEIKIibsT3NkG1THRfJPg,86,478,0

While the wait staff was very friendly and the decor was about what you'd expect for a BBQ joint (country pig-themed) I just couldn't stomach the R&B and rap music. What a huge disappointment. I'm kind of shocked. The only music you hear in restaurants out here is country and of all places country music would fit a BBQ joint. Heck ever classic rock. But rap and urban contemporary? Judging from the other people at Bradley's on the day I was there I bet most of them didn't appreciate it either. Having said that the place was packed and I attribute that to the exceptional food.

At the United terminal the booth is at baggage claim exit door 1E.  The man at the airport terminal booth/desk was friendly and efficient.   He quickly processed many people waiting in the line.   At the time I arrived at the booth after my flight there were about 30 people needing a ride.   Total time waiting from buying my ticket to getting on a bus was about 20 minutes.   Not bad for a busy time of day.  No worse than waiting for a Bud,4,1,9/04/2007,qgbbuhfSkH5_Tna5t9tE-A,160,279,0
#NAME?,DeMB9AsAoUMskzRStGnZmg,Okay if you're thinking about signing up for home dairy delivery you're probably wondering how it works. Here's the scoop: Once you sign up you will be assigned a delivery day based on your location. I'm in Baker just south of downtown Denver and it's Wednesday here. You can set a weekly order and adjust it up until 7pm of the night before your order. They offer milk (of course) juices cheese butter eggs cookie dough bottled water chip dips and plenty of other stuff. The deliveries for me are made before I leave for work which is at 5:50am. On my walk to the bus I do pass the delivery truck so it can't be too terribly long before that. Milk has never been hot or frozen when I take it in.

She was absolutely right though as I certainly did enjoy it thoroughly. We walked in and I had to roll my eyes and sigh. This place just screamed fast food.

This trip I went in to get the holiday sandwich and still being on Eastern time mentally if not geographically didn't realize it was only 10:35.  The cashier was nice enough about it so I just bought a lemonade and went next door to Arts and Artisans to browse.  But I was back at 11:00 to get my sandwich.

And lunch partner got a Chicken parm-like sandwich. The steak in the dish was well-done (and a little chewy). The Chicken sandwich was better. But both should not take well over an hour to prepare.

I had a lovely time when I stayed here except I was apparently right under the pool deck on the roof. That really wasn't a big deal and I think my room was discounted  because of it. It worked out perfect for me because the noise isn't something that really bothers me and they worked with me on the rate to get it closer to my travel budget.

They completely use fresh fruits and have a large variety. I have tried the strawberry avocado and mango flavors with much satisfaction.  Not only do they sell bubble tea but they have food as well.

#NAME?,heys0iwRjs5ZC7rTNn-iTQ,A friend of mine took me to this location of Torrid at Orland Square Mall since I wanted to look at some clothes for women that had thicker builds or were full figured. My only issue was the style of clothes because half the stuff was mostly gothic in nature. Plus there's a limit on certain styles of clothes for women of larger sizes like skirts and tops. Personally I don't think baby mini skirts are appropriate for women that are over the size of 24 with thick waist lines and hips.,4,1,5/20/2009,heys0iwRjs5ZC7rTNn-iTQ,76,185,0
#NAME?,NZba-Q-Fp10iF77CTQt24Q,I like this place because it's family owned and they are constantly trying to improve their flavors to make sure everything tastes the best. Many of the ices are simple flavors. I go by color more than actual flavor. The blue one I like is apparently raspberry. The two red ones are good... either Cherry or Strawberry. The ice gets scraped into a cup and you have a delicious icey feast to indulge yourself. I only stop in when I'm in the area but sometimes it seems to require an Italian Ice just to make my day. Those days require a special trip out to Memorial. Check them out if you're in the area. It's a nice business with good Italian ice. Yumm!,4,5,1/08/2010,NZba-Q-Fp10iF77CTQt24Q,270,932,0

Scoop serves gelato ice cream which seems more creamy than usual English ice cream but not as creamy as Haagen Dazs. There is a wide selection of flavours but not as wide as suggested on their website. Another slight problem is that the queue frequently stretches out of the door and it's hard to get a good view of all the flavours available. They're very happy to give you little tasters if you're not sure of your choice. There is a choice of cones available. Another little tip is that they will give you a combination of 2 flavours in a single scoop which are usually very generous in size.

#NAME?,PLOYtrCMUFPHQe2IbYAd5g,I was in Paris a few months back and came home with a nasty macaron addiction. Trying to find something even close to laudree has been a challenge....until I stopped at vanille on Saturday. Of course I had to get the 40 piece assortment for $35 which is a good price considering macarons are expensive. Vanille gets the texture and fillings exactly right - I'm finding that I like the more delicate flavors (rose lavender raspberry) while the husband likes the chocolate/caramel ones. We also took home a few entrements - cheesecake and chocolate mousse. It is rare to eat a cheesecake anything that can be described as light but this little jewel of a cake was.

#NAME?,G0FGeAGBj7IUFgCidXaSqg,Best coffee on The Hill. Hands down. I didn't find the baked goods to be all that great but they weren't bad either...just so-so. They are generous in their sizes though. I had contemplated a agle with lox and cream cheese. My friend recommended I didn't and hey since she frequents the place she ought to know. I went with a regular old bagle and cream cheese and it was ok but I like a little more shmear than they provided even though I did request and offer to pay for more. The atmosphere is great if you like some edge. I did since Boulder seems to lack a hell of a lot of edge. It was the only place I saw what I would consider a hipster as well...back in a more urban area they probably would have passed for joe shmoe though. The patio is dog-friendly as are the patrons.

#NAME?,JnPIjvC0cmooNDfsa9BmXg,I spent a lot of time in Victoria Station owing to the fact that my hotel (Sidney Hotel) was very closeby and that the express train to/from Gatwick goes directly here. Also there's a Sainsbury inside and I feel like I was there on an almost daily basis stuffing my face with Jaffa Cakes and Jelly Tots (neither of which can be had in Canada sadface). The station was fairly busy but nothing even remotely approaching the insanity that is Grand Central in New York or even Union Station in Toronto. It's big enough and there are enough exits and places to sit that you can easily avoid getting crushed by financial douches and hurried travellers if you're careful.

#NAME?,USZx-55MA2-lG2hBu6PWJA,Most of the times I have had pleasant experience taking the NYC cabs in and around the city limits. The cabbies by most are good people baring few who try to be extra smart. It has happened with me many times when the driver gave an excuse that the credit card machine is not working when I tried paying cash. I understand they end up paying tax on credit card payments but sometimes one does really not have cash to pay the fare.I try to avoid taking cabs unless I am in a hurry and reliable Subway train is not nearby.,3,3,3/05/2012,USZx-55MA2-lG2hBu6PWJA,29,559,0
#NAME?,F85UxlQM6YzVxSuddW8BQw,We come here frequently when in Rehoboth Beach not just because it's across the street from our favorite B&B or because it's locally sourced or even because they have a great gluten-free menu. We come here because we love the food and we're treated really well every time.  This is a wickedly popular restaurant in the heart of the gay neighborhood and across the street from one of the biggest gay bars.  You can best believe they get swamped.  Come here for lunch unless you make a dinner reservation. When you're seated expect your host will ask you a lot of questions about food allergies or dietary requirements.  I have a double whammy of gluten and corn sensitivity so they not only steer me clear of anything that's going to contain those ingredients they also will prepare special meals,5,0,6/27/2011,F85UxlQM6YzVxSuddW8BQw,29,267,0

I was only left with a few boutique hotels in mind; but no complaints here. Once I came across W's page on ol' Yelp I was pleased and booked my one-night stay via http://Hotels.com.

The outlet boasts that you can save 30%-70% 'every day' which is pretty realistic. This location is never that busy so you can usually shop without much interruption or annoyances from other customers and excessive sales staff. The outlet has a lot to offer from clothing shoes to some home decor products.

What one needs on 6th at this point is to fill a niche other than coffee:  good food excellent pastries late hours events meeting space or some such.  Bluebeard has space but it's not really open late enough to make much of it nor do they offer much in the way of food. Ambiance - an identity - is a factor with this many coffee houses around and Bluebeard doesn't really have anything one way or the other.  It's very neutral,3,5,5/16/2011,Vd5ZQKvhdXS3WgECV78_hQ,79,427,0

Service was almost nonexistent largely due to only 2 servers taking care of the entire dining room and carryout service. Steak Fajitas are sliced razor thin and the sizzling plate was 60% onions and I didn't find the peppers and few slices of tomato until I was pretty much done.  Given the choice of corn or flour tortillas I went with flour.  The plate arrived with 2 large tortillas which really don't go well with fajitas.  Usually you get the smaller size size whether flour or corn.

It's rooms a funky and cool brightly colored with an old film camera on display in each room. The facilities are decent with an awesome set of pools too cool off in one with a tall waterfall. The hammock zen-spot was a great place to work on my iPad and take a nap. It's located in Old Town Scottsdale which is like a movie set but small and not open that late. Overall I'd give it 3 stars -- it's certainly not ritzy nor is it in an amazing location and the internet is pretty weak however the staff is amazing and single-handedly earns another star for this review.

First thing to know is that you enter the building for the tour through one of the loading docks in the back not the door marked entrance. The other thing to consider is this tour is pretty rough. No fancy marketing or movies or cute tasting room. Just some taps sticking out of the side of their cold storage container and some shelves holding the merch. The tour is not super detailed but it was interesting. They explained stuff in decent detail and gave the story about the how the company has grown.

#NAME?,f1MFQxTZAWJnRQdrouLg_A,Sometimes I feel like The Roasterie Cafe is a parody of a coffee shop. The baristas are so very hip the clientele is so very yuppie but damn if their coffee isn't so very good. These people do all sorts of awesome things. Their more traditional coffee drinks are always top notch and while their specialty drinks all look a bit too sweet for my taste I have it on good authority that they are in fact quite tasty. They also do regular coffee in many different forms: drip french press and pour over. I've never had a pour over but barista friends tell me that it'll change my life. If that's the case I'll probably save it for a really bad day. The seating area is a bit loud but it's loud enough that everything blends into a white noise that allows me to work pretty well.

Kevin convinced me that it was a good idea to grab a quick breakfast at Sol's before taking Shadow to White Rock Dog Park. It was not such a bright idea. First off the service is pretty much terrible here. We had three different servers and none of them came out to check on us. They took our order brought out the chips/salsa and fruit and delivered our food (which was wrong the first time around). It took me leaving with Shadow to go to the car to get her attention for our check. We sat on the patio because of our pup and he started panting after just a few minutes. I noticed no signs of dog bowls anywhere so I emptied a small bowl on our table and filled it with water for him. When she delivered o,2,11,6/13/2010,KO7CuK8p5u4AFGQ7voXe9g,114,561,0

Manny brought the pizza over to the table and even mentioned how good the pie looked. I took a picture to show how perfectly it was cooked.

They accept appointments - you can also walk in and wait for an opening. The longest I've ever had to wait is about 30 minutes when they are really busy. They don't have a web site - so you will have to call them for an appointment.

Really liked the decor and atmosphere as well as the attractive people. Onto the food. We shared a ton of appys got the salmon beef carpaccio (amazing) pork belly(avoid no fat at all you might as well eat pork loin) and the lobster. For the trey trey out of the 6 of us there 5 got the steak frites with half salad half fries. The steak had no char and was underwhelming. The other friend who opted out of the steak got the sweetbreads. Those too were lacking of flavor. With the selection of restaurants in Montreal these days I probably would not go back.

All of our food has beautifully presented (think Iron Chef America style) and a real pleasure to consume. The service is what really takes the cake at Seasons. It's impeccable. Proof? They bring you a stool for your purse. Granted the second time we had to ask for the cute little stools but that's only because they only have nine and all nine were being used.

The service was great  but on a Monday at 1pm in a high traffic area the place was pretty empty.  It could be because the location is a bit hidden and their business isn't listed on the sign facing Montgomery Road (They are housed in a location that is notorious for failed restaurants Dick Clark's anyone?).   I liked their chips and salsa I actually thought the salsa had a really great flavor but I don't consider myself to be connoisseur of chips and salsa either.  For lunch I had the quesadilla fajita and it was OK I didn't like the chees,2,0,7/11/2011,STskVv3kxVerS9OAc36FiQ,62,180,0

#NAME?,0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA,I'm sure it's no secret that I am one who avoids buffets like the plague so I was more than pleasantly surprised by Jerusalem Café and Bakery. I had dined in their restaurant last year and although I had thought Aladdin's hummus and falafel was a bit tastier I still thought JC was pretty damn good. This JC (there are three in KC I believe) is all about the faster food experience (all serve yourself). The buffet offers up a whole lot of options such as: Two varieties moussaka (veg and meat. The veggie variety was *really* good) regular and red pepper hummus falafel array of cold salads (olive!) 1 pizza choice (looked rather dried out and w/ meat) Gyro hot vegetables chicken curry beef kofta meatloaf rice smokey babaganoush (yum!! and normally I don't like babaganoush) Aaaand probably mo,4,7,6/01/2010,0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA,95,1010,0

Well we got to this place around 10pm and as we walked in the place looked really empty.  Mind you fridays is Ska Punk Reggae night.  So main room was playing some punk.   Place itself has some red lighting and the decor from what I could make out of it was spanish inspired.  Overall decor itself was cool.. So we walk out back to The Patio and let me tell you this is definitely were everyone was at.  We found the bday girl and her entourage of 20 and began to mingle.  The spot itself outside is small but its outdoors.

The staff did an excellent job of making us feel welcome. Our server did a good job too. There was a little mix up with our order but they were able to fix it.

Three women cleaned the house and it seemed to be pretty quick so I was pleasantly surprised to find that the house was left almost spotless. I do realize that most cleaning services are up front about the fact that it may take 3 or so cleanings to get the house completely cleaned. I was told on the phone that the first cleaning would be considered a deep cleaning and so was told an estimate of between 130 and 180 for the size of the house. Now I completely understand that without seeing the house and the level of cleanliness there would be a give or take 50 dollars. Plus I have two cats. All cool and clear about that.

I like Gordman's because even though they have not as many name brand brands at TJ Maxx they seem to have a better selection both style-wise and size-wise. (It is more of a department store feel instead of a bargain outlet feel.) Besides a good selection of clothing they also have a pretty big selection of sports team memorabilia (KU K-State Mizzou) shoes pajamas and home decor especially for the holidays.

I love that place so much I was afraid it would be a cruel joke to lure me in and sell me sub-par Middle Eastern food. This is definitely the same with the same menu even. The atmosphere is not as pleasant as the Little Rock location mostly I think because it has newly opened and it isn't really decorated. It's very light and open at the wall along the windows and gets progressively darker toward the back. But it is casual and easy-going and definitely DEFINITELY welcoming!

#NAME?,TYfZrIzz08VGmvvvGZhqyw,I thoroughly enjoyed my first tast of Ethiopian food. I attended this restaurant in a larger group to celebrate a birthday and they were wonderful. We tried to keep it simple by ordering the family style (medium spice) and had a great time trying the variety of items that came with the meal. My personal favorite was the beets and lamb. The restaurant staff was friendly and provided a delicious free dessert for the birthday boy. We also had a gluten free person in our group and they made special food for her when we called ahead (very nice). My only complaint is that the day I was there it was around 80 degrees and there was no air conditioning- but loved everything else about the place.

It's a completely unique experience that I'll try to successfully sum up in this review but it's 100% worthy of a visit during your trip and even if you're a local. Much like many other places I visit in the keys the atmosphere at Pepe's is so cool & cozy... it almost feels like you're in a tree house on their back patio. Seating is pretty limited but you're more than welcome to grab a drink at the bar while you wait and the most important thing to know about Pepe's is that every single one of their juices are fresh squeezed... they actually do it in front of you at the bar.

We called around to a few spots and the best deal that we could find was what Angle offered: $45 for a manicure and pedicure SOLD! The color assortment was okay but not great as some of the trendiest colors were missing but they did carry Essie and OPI brands. Service was efficient and well-done too. I thoroughly enjoyed the massage chair especially because she completed both services while I was perched in my seat. Most other salons make you move to a manicure table post pedicure which is not nearly as comfortable. Great location that is located next to the Publix grocery store makes for a convenient afternoon of running errands! I would definitely check thi,4,0,6/04/2011,5Y5KbsI5buMcNh2hTFaRpA,94,580,0

#NAME?,biZ0fIcZp7B-KBJ3EGcX7Q,Wow.  That's all I can say.  Just recently I have started taking Metra while commuting to and from work.  Having come from years of riding CTA/Pace only I was taken aback the first time on a Metra train.  The hours I work are overnights so the trains obviously are never overcrowded and the fact that I can actually stretch out on the seat and take a nap is the best perk of them all.  I can be found taking the BNSF line and only once in the last two months have the trains been running behind  (and it was only ten minutes late).  The fares are reasonable ($3.60 from Downer's Grove to Union Station) and you have many options for rides like a 10-ride ticket or a monthly pass for only $120.  All in all I'm glad I have the option to take Metra and would suggest it to anyone trying to ease,5,5,2/24/2007,biZ0fIcZp7B-KBJ3EGcX7Q,268,543,1

First off the grounds are impeccable. Everything is manicured and thoughtfully laid out. It's a sprawling resort so you may have a longish walk to things like the pool or main building. Usually hotel catering is....meh. Camelback Inn does it right though - every meal I ate here was fresh and delicious. The staff was really on their game replenishing things frequently and making sure diners had drinks etc. One of the common topics at this conference was how great the food was - one afternoon they rolled out a cart with homemade ice cream bars. Awesome. The staff here is also exceptional - they are unfailingly friendly and helpful. All around this place is first class ,5,1,10/20/2012,PLOYtrCMUFPHQe2IbYAd5g,84,498,0

The staff is sometimes challenged by common sense however and you can get into arguments with them over whether a streetlight in the middle of the city is in fact owned by them or CalTrans - even when it has a City of San Diego street sign on it.

The sushi won't cause a stomach ache later but it still isn't on-par with quality sushi. I blame the overabundance of faux-sushi restaurants for setting the standard for sushi quality lower as the masses are now more lenient with what  constitutes as genuine sushi having most likely experienced too many instances of poor sushi in the past to believe this place serves the real deal.

Our greeter was making all the excuses in the world as he knew that he gave our table away. Even though we had to pre-pay when we made the reservation. What a frickin scam! They asked what we wanted to eat and all 6 of us ordered the filet medium rare. The soup came out and it was out of this world. I have never had potato leek soup before.

It's fun they have concerts indoors and outdoors and some specials (like Dollar Fridays where they have dollar hot dogs dollar draft beer and dollar bets).

#NAME?,NfU0zDaTMEQ4-X9dbQWd9A,I'm just going to go ahead and put this out there now: THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES IN CLEVELAND. Why? I don't even know where to start! Well first of all as soon as you walk in you feel like you're experiencing a part of Cleveland's history.  Seriously. It's like you stepped into the city about 100 years ago right in the hustle and bustle of everything. What a fantastic feeling. I for one feel great knowing that some things never change. You feel like you are truly a part of the community. It's a place where you can come together and enjoy the different cultures and people who make up this fantastic city we all love.   Secondly I can't think of a bad time to go.  The busy Saturdays make me feel alive and part of a much greater purpose. You'll see families of all walks of life spe,5,4,7/26/2010,NfU0zDaTMEQ4-X9dbQWd9A,76,440,1
#NAME?,3qdOo7aWhIHWrKuT9jw3Gg,I've been to Olive or Twist a few times now but haven't had the urge to order food so my review is based only on my alcohol adventures. We snuck in this past weekend for a few drinks -- and to get out of the swarming crowds on Sixth and Market Square because of Light Up Night festivities. Thankfully some fantastic people told us of its upstairs bar area. What?! How did I totally miss this on my previous visits finding only a tight tiny squeeze area with happy hour-goers near the lower level bar? The openness of the upstairs only lends more positive points towards its star rating on this establishment. The beer list is decent and vodka was generously poured (read: not an overkill of cranberry and/or tonic) and bar staff was attentive -- thankfully pleasant given the rush of patrons. ,4,2,11/22/2010,3qdOo7aWhIHWrKuT9jw3Gg,33,314,0

Our group of 4 sat at the hibachi tables.  3 ate hibachi I had sushi.   I ordered 2 sushi rolls spider (crab) and shrimp tempura.  The spider roll fell apart and the shrimp tempura roll had no crunch to it.  The tempura was soggy.  A previous reviewer complained his rolls were not tightly wrapped and I'd agree since mine fell apart.  There was hardly any crab or shrimp in mine.  My 2 rolls cost $14 definitely a lot ,1,2,5/03/2011,3lUkFxUQKeMUYH7-z_kmjg,4,131,0

However we had a 6pm reservation and were immediately led upstairs. The service started out well. Our waiter was polite courteous and very helpful. I asked if the sangria was available that night - he went to ask and returned quickly to let me know they would make a fresh batch for me. Nice! But by the time appetizers arrived we began to see our waiter too much.

#NAME?,mffer6ORgLqxB8ZeemxmHQ,We joined a few friends in celebrating their recent engagement.  I have always been on the fence with this place but it is a very convenient location for after work gatherings.  The menu has a lot of strange variety and there should be something for just about everyone.  We had the giant nachos and they were good.  We also split a corned beef and cabbage.  We wanted it more of an appetizers but it came with a slit plate.  I am not sure but I can imagine there was a charge associated with it.  I had a couple drinks and aside from being overpriced they were good.  Our server was very nice and attentive.  I will likely go back. but it usually is not my first choice for going out.

I made reservations for 7:00pm on a Saturday night and was surprised to find the restaurant half empty upon arrival (or half full--I guess I'm forever a pessimist). Personally I found the decor drool-inducing. Sometimes I wish I were a bachelor just so I could decorate my imaginary one bedroom high rise condo in just such a fashion just as Custom House. Fun. The service was hit or miss. Our server seemed to hate us from the get go. I think the manager sensed this because she was at our table several times delivering food and taking requests.

-I8JaeSMF6MHO--0_MqKRw,Egu4qSFR56EhGuTHZTaVjA,Vail was awesome - no surprise there - compared to other resort towns I've been to there are so many more stores restaurants bars and interesting nooks and crannies to explore when off-mountain. On-mountain most the runs aren't necessarily made for beginners (note how nice easy green run Flapjack drops right into black diamond Log Chute) and the week we were there was unfortunately lacking in new snow. This resulted in the groomed areas being very rough for beginner-level snowboarders (like myself). Icy catwalks and tight turns make for some pretty epic falls and an increased need to be really aggressive with your edges. But the weather aside we had a fantastic trip. Once you get the hang of the shuttle system there's honestly no need for a car. And be prepared for a wait at the lift-,4,0,12/26/2011,Egu4qSFR56EhGuTHZTaVjA,133,725,0

It also has the advantage of being not quite so busy so we got in immediately instead of having to wait 30-45 minutes.  We had their regular ribeye and the nice thing was that the cooks were able actually to make one steak come out medium and the other medium well. That isn't always the case at chain steakhouses. We had mashed potatoes with our meal but they don't have gravy.  The potatoes were fine but I prefer some garlic flavor in mine when I make them.  Our service was great and reasonably fast as well even though the restaurant was pretty full with the after church crowd.

Though this was my fourth time attending NQA it was my first time joining them for their lunch at Barley's. When I'm in the area I usually choose something else but Barley's is a good option for a respite from Convention Center madness. The burgers on the menu looked especially good but I went with a wedge salad. As observed from my dining mates' orders: it's easy to have many options for your side even with a burger. Fries are not the default and there are healthier options readily available and upfront on the menu. Honestly for this type of place I was impressed with the wedge.

#NAME?,Y4Du3cllZ_gpNjzTvmeZ0Q,One of the more beautiful Arboretums you will ever run into. Nestled in Overland Park's boondocks the OP Arboretum is a gorgeous place to take a drive out to and get away from the normal grind and give your brain some colorful eye candy. If you are into photography (As my wife and I are) you will most definitely appreciate the wide variety of plant species and the modestly chosen colors that are combined with them. IMHO the best time of the year to go enjoy this place is probably the last week of April / First week of May. It's locally the peak for tulips and various spring flowers. At the same time it's horribly packed with folks so do expect a busier Arboretum. The pictures posted by me are from May 25th 2009.,4,9,9/07/2009,Y4Du3cllZ_gpNjzTvmeZ0Q,206,562,0

He could have been more articulate but a guy from Guest Services did a nice job telling my wife and I about grocery stores in the area (I ended up buying the items we needed at the gift shop). +Great location. The hotel is just a few blocks from Disneyland and California Adventure Park (our room was facing one of the big parking lots). A lot of stores and restaurants are also in the area (if you need to catch a bus there's a bus stop right outside the parking lot). +The prices at Tivoli Gardens Café are reasonable the menu is somewhat diverse and the staff is friendly (see my review if you want more i,3,13,10/15/2010,eyx42e79U0UEIqWabS1GEA,39,278,0

The girl on the phone told me the driver tried to call and since I didn't answer he left.

They spend more time focusing on endangered species and eco-friendly matters that they drain a lot of fun out of it.

A grocery store that's open until midnight for those of us who like to stroll over at 11:40pm on a Friday and buy the week's goods is a godsend. Two negatives: One I take umbrage with the fact that they are LITERALLY always out of Pirate's Booty. Whoever distributes PB in San Francisco needs to shape up because the display case is always empty and not because I've just Supermarket Sweep-ed™ the shelf. And two the layout of this store lacks logic. Safeway needs to hire a better store planner or merchandiser because nothing is where you would typically expect it to be in a normal grocery store.

Consistently I have gone on Tuesdays and been server burgers well past Medium Well. I have gone Wednesdays and Thursdays and the burgers have been fine. Friendly staff at the register and in the dining room. They serve Coke Zero always a plus in my book. Parking is still a cluster fuck here - park down by the vision store and walk back - worth the walk and the lessened chance of damage to your vehicle from errant parkers up front.

The pork buns were really really good and the vegetable garnish added a nice texture. The seaweed salad (one of my new favorite things) was great too...our table ended up devouring it. We spilled each of these dishes all over the table. All four of us got the Zuzu Ramen. The broth was a little different than I was used to but there was a lot of deliciousness going on - huge pieces of rich char siu an egg forty yards of noodles and a bunch of other things I ate without examining too much.

The arroz con pollo is a bit heavy (particularly because they use a lot of cheese sauce and their sauce is very rich) but the spinach enchiladas are AMAZING- they are filled with spinach and cheese that is flavorful and not too heavy covered in lettuce with tomato sour cream and guacamole on top and served with beans and rice.  I'm not much for vegetarian options when I go out but I'd definitely order this again.  And again.  And again.

Finally after they noticed they had customers we headed to the table. After getting our coffees we headed to the buffet to check out the spread. Plenty of normal breakfast foods including various egg dishes fruits granola/yogurt salads fried chicken bread puddings etc. Standouts were the broccoli/cheese casserole ham fresh fruit and the biscuits with gravy.

It is one of those tourist attractions that local residents actually also visit and use regularly.   A local's tips: - The majority of the stalls open by 8:30 although they say they don't open until 9.  Shop at 8:30 if you can - you will get the best selection and avoid the crowds. - Be sure to wander around the rest of Granville Island to get a bit away from the crowds.  Some spots worth wandering off to include Go Fish (a 5-10 minute walk from the market) which offers outdoor seafood specialties with a gourmet flair (opened by the chef behind Bin 941),5,2,12/24/2008,RqR1bGDgdOPyHDnI73LeFw,551,1132,1

When they aren't items are just as much as any other stores.  They have a lot of stuff to look at so make sure that you stick with a list otherwise you may walk out with so much more stuff that you don't need! Returns are easy as well. I had to return a couple of items and it was a breeze. I just wish they would put more cashiers. They have such an awesome displays of cash register counters and for the most part only one or maybe two people are working.

As for women's clothes I know they carry a number of designer brands and I've tried on a few things there but have never purchased for one reason or another. The gift section upstairs is very fun & unique.  This is not a store that you want to run into looking scruffy BTW,4,4,9/30/2009,0Igx-a1wAstiBDerGxXk2A,302,917,0
#NAME?,Q1E3bkn8odFZhnfkGMBSDQ,The Heritage Trail is an old railroad that's been converted into a crushed gravel hiking and biking trail. As you'd expect it's very flat - easy to ride but not much of a challenge for serious mountain bikers. The trail is 26 miles long and stretches between Dubuque and Dyersville. A great place to take a leisurely bike ride or stroll. Keep an eye out for the old concrete milage markers from the railroad!,4,0,5/21/2006,Q1E3bkn8odFZhnfkGMBSDQ,123,190,0

It was quite pricey for lunch but we all thought the food was delicious. My bf had an amazing looking house burger- tried a bite and it was perfect cooked exactly as he ordered. We split the spinach artichoke dip (loved it) and I enjoyed a watermelon and arugala salad that had great fresh ingredients that I found refreshing. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was very nice- it appeared like a great spot tucked away in a cute downtown area.

The ice creams at Elle & Bee are on the higher end side.  The flavors are clear and clean.  They are definitely trying to appeal to teens and families - cute graphics and core selection of flavors.  Nothing terribly unusual just solid frozen confections. Punch Card alert!  Plus - they run different promos during the week including Matinee Mondays (20% off your order before 4) and $2 for a small froyo on Thursdays. Prices are average:  Yogurt ranges $2.5 for small original to $6.25 for large flavored.  Toppings are $1.  Ice cream is $3.25 for one scoop and only $1 more for 2 ,4,1,7/22/2011,Vd5ZQKvhdXS3WgECV78_hQ,79,427,0

It could have used a little more flavor though. The beef was o.k. Nothing to talk about. The mostacchioli in red sauce was really bad. It had no taste and there was hardly any sauce. The pasta salad really wasn't any better. The potato salad was acceptible. But everything was cut into huge chunks. I guess this place is known for their pizza but I'll never find that out.

The hotel attracts mainly business travelers Vs. tourists but it doesn't have the air of pretension that many business hotels can have. The Ames is pragmatic classy and very conveniently located Quincy market is just a stones throw away!

As it is Midway is cool because it had outdoor baseball long before the Twins finally escaped the pitiful Dome.  Midway hosted the only time I've seen R.E.M. live (in the rain no less).  It has a small but OK parking lot for tailgating which is rare in the Cities as a large-scale activity.  Although if you want a spot in the lot you better arrive early.  I've attended the Iceball (old timey baseball in the snow) event a couple times which is an experience not easily forgotten.   Midway gets points for the train chugging by outside the outfield wall for crazy gimmicks and ,4,0,3/13/2012,lMAeHqAsdvgV6KFz53e1Dw,35,304,0

#NAME?,sj6MuZEA5To_lYn2acfaXQ,I'm married to a 48 year old who it 12 at heart. On our 'romantic' weekend in Kenosha to celebrate my birthday he discovered the Jelly Belly factory and had I not agreed to go I would have spent the weekend with a pouting 48/12 year old. It was actually kind of fun. The warehouse is tricked out in a low budget Disney-esque manner with over sized signs and giant videos describing the Jelly Belly process. An ad for JB but interesting. My 48/12 loved the gift shop. I think he spent $75 on discount candy. Yeah I'm like 'how many jelly beans can one man eat?' but he was out to discover the answer. He even bought a case of Hanukkah beans (we're not Jewish). Anyway go. Then take your 12 year old to the Dinosaur museum in downtown Kenosha.,4,0,1/04/2009,sj6MuZEA5To_lYn2acfaXQ,83,293,1

CONS: The ambience isn't great at all and the service is seriously the absolute bare minimum.

The location of this hotel is great.  It is a block off the expressway and very close to Super Target Panda Express and many other places to get a quick meal.   That is the positive side to it.  The negative side to its location is that it is a block off the expressway and very close to Super Target Panda Express and many other places to get a quick meal.  So it is very noisy.  There was constant external noise as well as a constant slamming of doors from rooms around us.  Seems to have very thin walls and windows.   The room was clean but just did not feel new.  I am not sure how old this location,2,3,5/27/2012,1iJ4HoDOGSeIdyZQG6Qzww,83,192,0

The dogs are basic low quality steamed and slapped into a bun.  The chili sauce is a bit too runny for me but apparently that helps it get squeezed through the pneumatic grease gun quicker.  It certainly helped it go through me quicker. The cheese is liquid squirt-on.  The onions are pretty good though diced beyond recognition they take on a goopy onion-paste appearance.

#NAME?,NfU0zDaTMEQ4-X9dbQWd9A,I grew up with this little Malley's Chocolate and ice cream shop although I will say I've never been a big chocolate fan. We always went for the hard-packed ice creams and warm fudge and caramel sauces. Yes I realize that fudge=chocolate but for some reason when this glorious stuff runs down your sundae nothing can keep you from eating it. Anyways I really haven't had a reason to visit a Malley's recently but I needed to bring a little Cleveland treat to my co-workers for our regional trip to DC. So I stopped in and with the help of a couple of teens I found a large box of buckeyes and a smaller box of some sort of toffee/chocolate/almond bark to pack along in my luggage. The service was pretty OK while the teens didn't know really how to help me. But I can't really make a full-on ,4,2,10/05/2012,NfU0zDaTMEQ4-X9dbQWd9A,76,440,0
#NAME?,nt143HoSFyPLsVNaI1fGrQ,I am not going to waste anyone's time by telling you what the place looked like what all they sell whether or not I got friendly service... I don't think it matters.  The chocolate is a little piece of heaven. A BIG piece of heaven.  They may be expensive but those truffles are better than drugs.  I would do pretty much anything for these truffles... and I do mean anything.  They are rich and delicious and ohmygosh- I think I need to drive to Coloma and get some right now.   Mmmmm. LUCKILY!! You do not need to drive to Coloma.  You can order this delicious goodness.  If that someone special in your life is a chocolate lover and you love them - you would probably order some for them. :),5,2,11/18/2009,nt143HoSFyPLsVNaI1fGrQ,49,266,0
#NAME?,e0lV0WyRCYbYs9k6chh8YA,This review is for the Pasta Demonstration and Luncheon that was part of Vegas Uncorked 2009. The event started with an introduction by Hugh Garvey from Bon Appetit Magazine. Then Chef Carlos took us through the process for making several types of Pasta and answered questions from the audience. I think he would make an outstanding TV Chef. He was funny informative and engaging. Before the presentation we got to sample some Prosecco and Arancini (little fried balls of rice that were stuffed with beef and cheese). They were both wonderful! After the demonstration we were treated to a buffet that included an antipasto platter a wonderful pear salad with Balsamic Sherry Vinaigrette Tortelloni Raviolini and some wonderful Lobster Gnocchi.

Yes but  I think Lou Malnati's can roll with the big boys of deep dish pizza too. If you've never had deep dish pizza before and are going to Chicago give your self some time allowance because it takes about 30 minutes at least to cook a nice deep dish pizza and also the lines that can wrap around the place. We got smart. My husband has never eaten deep dish pizza in his life so I took him at lunch time where he can experience better time to eat deep dish pizza.

There were no lions tigers or snow leopards anywhere. And the one polar bear in the whole joint was passed out under a rock where no one could see him.

Prior to ordering my burger I checked the menu for other specialties.  The front of the menu indicates that wings are what they do.  I had to try 10 of them.  They were pretty bad.  The garlic were nearly flavorless the hot BBQ were simply BBQ.  Thankfully they didn't run me more tha,3,1,8/03/2009,uL-ECTF9PumWkzxHScw-QA,166,392,0
#NAME?,K8jpilJCv962HKT-Vt7VsQ,Didn't like. I was hesitant to eat here but from where my party of four was staying it was easy to walk to. Most reviews indicate this is a great place for breakfast and not so great for lunch and dinner.  Well when passing the place in the morning there was a line out the door.  However at night it was like a ghost town.  I suspect most of these reviews are dead on.  I wish I had been able to eat here for breakfast instead. In most businesses the better more seasoned employees get better hours.  For most that equates to morning/day hours.  That may explain why the breakfast is the most highly rated. Mediocre food and service.  Going for breakfast?  Consider it.  Going for lunch or dinner?  Skip it.,2,1,8/08/2011,K8jpilJCv962HKT-Vt7VsQ,125,323,0
#NAME?,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,Cool Springs Park is off of U.S. 50 deep in the mountains of West Virginia. It's a welcome oasis for the traveler - all the essentials are here:  restrooms a lunch counter convenience store offerings gas - as well as a bunch of stuff you don't find at most convenience stores:  Buckwheat flour Indian Moccasins Tom-toms etc. Roadside America has a snippet about the place: http://www.roadsideameri… Stopped in to use the restrooms gas up the car and get some cold beverages. Cool place! Oh - and the gas pumps are full-service - I could not figure out why there was this older woman hanging out by the gas pumps overseeing my pumping the gas - apparently I was doing her job - but I did not stop to wait for someone as I was unaware of the full service...,5,5,6/20/2009,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,1388,2530,0
#NAME?,wzyGNvArcpUjZauRWFrKHA,This is how we do it!     That is what my close personal friend Montell Jordan* said ironically after we dined here because let me tell you what BK this is most definitely NOT how you do it. I mean I've been going to Burger King since I was a lower case G but this location does not represent.  There were more workers than customers and it still took over five minutes to get a cheeseburger at 6:00 pm.  That's dinner time yo!  Why does it take so long when so many people are standing around with blank looks on their faces rather than making my burger? Also the place was not clean.  Tables were dirty floor not mopped.   To all my neighbors at the BK regrettably you do not have much flavor.

#NAME?,lRHUkES8HnFAqdoi4hwNkg,This location used to an old National City branch before PNC bought them out. The place is still open but now under the PNC banner. There's a drive-up ATM and lanes to speak with a teller from your car. I've also been on the inside of this branch. The employees here are very friendly and they also have a coffee station with Keurig inserts. Yes they are wasteful but I'll be damned if it isn't good java! Overall as big banks go this PNC branch has done well by me. I don't know if they still offer it to new customers but if so ask about their 4% cash back on gas Visa Rewards card.,4,0,4/29/2012,lRHUkES8HnFAqdoi4hwNkg,92,503,0
#NAME?,GG7Xg-09i2RCSily3JYHtQ,Nothing really special about Italia Gardens. The food is OK -- I say OK because I've had really great experiences coupled with pretty terrible ones so I guess on average it's a good spot to get some standard Italian fare. A favorite that has yet to disappoint: the baked mostaccoli. I order it on every visit -- definitely a safe bet.,3,0,9/16/2008,GG7Xg-09i2RCSily3JYHtQ,42,144,0

I will admit that I always go to Ginda at the bar.  That said there is some serious eye-candy here for us boys... ;) Strong drinks $1 wells/$2 domestics on Sunday.  I'd recommend it.,4,2,11/07/2008,Sf2foJo2qBAGHQRTimVFSw,7,107,0
#NAME?,ix9ISUHeOUkx8WhVTfx-xA,The pizza was decent enough-though I have found that pizza taste is a hugely subjective issue. My problem wasn't with the product but the service!  The service was horrible from start to finish.  I called for delivery and the person taking my order was very short bordering on rude.  I can overlook this because I understand the restaurant could be busy.  But there is no excuse for the delivery driver to be hostile and rude!  Unbeknownst to me my door buzzer was broke so the driver called my phone. I couldn't get to it before he hung up but I figured it was the pizza so I immediately headed downstairs to pay for the pizza.  On my way down the order taker from the restaurant called and was very rude to me; I explained I was on my way downstairs.  When I got downstairs (less than two minutes ,2,2,1/22/2008,ix9ISUHeOUkx8WhVTfx-xA,0,18,1
#NAME?,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,I admit that I'm probably a little older than the focused age group for AE shoppers. But they do have some cute clothes for layering or for casual wear. Am I wearing this to the office? No. But am I throwing it on for comfort and wear around the house and on weekends? Yes.

#NAME?,xEQ20W2KZlAXod5qHhkG9g,I went to this yoga studio faithfully for almost a year until I moved out of state. Most of the classes are taught by Bridget the owner of the studio. When I go to yoga I'm not looking for answers to life's questions; I want a teacher who will push me physically to develop flexibility strength and stamina. With Bridget she really believes the whole yoga philosophy so you get some of that but the workout is just so amazing I would encourage you to go even if you think yogis are weird. I've probably sat under 10 yoga instructors in my life and Bridget more than any of them clearly understands the human body and is very attentive always aware of what the students are doing and teaching postures so you know what to look for to make sure you're not overextending or putting too much press,5,2,7/16/2011,xEQ20W2KZlAXod5qHhkG9g,17,91,0

#NAME?,2vJ2e51kdbdAmAo_HTr4KQ,I often mix up Milestone's and Moxie's - not just because they both start with the letter 'M' but big chain restaurants often serve the same food drinks appetizers and soon morph into the same entity. I decided to meet up with my boyfriend midweek day for something casual and we didn't feel like going far from my work so I chose Milestone's. There are two levels to this restaurant and as soon as you walk in you are given the choice to eat upstairs or at the bar (main level). We chose a booth by the bar and ordered beer and wine galore. We started with 2 orders of the burger sliders (yum!) and sweet potato fries. I need to mention that the sliders although ordinary in its conception and probably relatively easy to cook was delicious.

#NAME?,G0FGeAGBj7IUFgCidXaSqg,I attended Beer with a Buddy at the Nomad tonight and it was fantastic! Entry is 10 dollars. They also partner with a sponsor that comes in and there are raffles and games (ring wine toss anyone?) to raise money. This weeks sponsor was Underdog Rescue and they even had a couple of their foster dogs wearing vests that you could stuff donations into. There were MANY more dogs than I had anticipated and for the most part all of the dogs were well behaved. Of course you are always going to get the over-excited or stressed dog in an enviornment like this so if you are expecting a smooth-sailing night where you can sit back with your beer and ignore your dog this isn't a place for you.

Heres a pointer for your faux chic place - get some meat maybe a little cheese and a couple of ingredients and add THOSE to your pizza. Since when has pizza been about selling crappy bread and a snooty attitude? I'm also 93.45% sure you'll get a food borne illness if you eat their salad but don't hold me to it. I'll save you the $10-12 and you can come over to my place and I'll wad up a couple pieces of wonder bread and dip them in ragu.

#NAME?,h9MZv5I1hvTX1kkzq-3Cvg,The shuttle guy from the hotel recommended this place. I realize I am from Texas so getting good authentic Cajun food isn't hard. With that said this place is awful in terms of food. I ordered the crawfish andouille flatbread and it was terrible. Firstly it wasn't a flatbread; it was a pizza. Secondly there was brown oil dripped from the andouille which made the pizza soggy. Thirdly because the pizza was soggy it was hard to eat. I was picking at it so badly that the waiter and the owner talked me into getting another dish. I decided on the Scallop Mac Daddy. It was better but not by much. I've decided seafood and macaroni & cheese probably aren't the best combination. The scallops were big (see picture) which was good but they gave the mac & cheese a weird flavor.
